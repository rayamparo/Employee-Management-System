# Employee-Management-System
For the most part, I belive I got everything working. To be brutally honest, I had A LOT of help from James regarding this assignment and the only reason why I didn't finish the remove functions was becuase he fell asleep and stopped slacking me and I also was running out of time and decided it'd be better to send in what I have. With that being said, this was difficult and I am sorry Senpai Wilson that I did not fully complete it. Forgive me Senpai....

P.S. I just noticed I did not fully make the find the employee by Department work properly. Please don't give me anything less than an A- Senpai.
